## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

When creating a bug report, include:
1. **Clear title and description**
2. **Steps to reproduce the issue**
3. **Expected behavior**
4. **Actual behavior**
5. **System information** (macOS version, ZSH version)
6. **Relevant log entries** from `move_desktop_items.log`
7. **Screenshots** if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:
1. **Use case** - Why is this enhancement needed?
2. **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
3. **Alternatives considered** - What other solutions did you think about?
4. **Additional context** - Mockups, examples, etc.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the coding standards** (see below)
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Write clear commit messages**
6. **Submit a pull request** with a comprehensive description

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS or Linux
- ZSH shell (install via package manager on Linux)
- Git
- For Linux testing: `gio` or `trash-cli` (optional but recommended)

### Local Development

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tuhaj/clean_rush_fun.git
cd clean_rush_fun
```

2. Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Make your changes to `clean_rush_fun.zsh`

4. Test your changes:
```bash
# Create a test directory with sample files
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/test_cleanup
touch ~/Desktop/test_cleanup/file{1..5}.txt

# Run the script
./clean_rush_fun.zsh
```

5. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your change"
```

## Coding Standards

### Shell Script Guidelines

1. **Use meaningful variable names**
```bash
# Good
POINTS_FOR_MOVE=10

# Bad
P_M=10
```

2. **Add comments for complex logic**
```bash
# Check if achievement threshold is reached and not already unlocked
if [[ $new_total -ge $threshold && $TOTAL_SORTS -lt $threshold ]]; then
```

3. **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces)

4. **Quote variables to prevent word splitting**
```bash
# Good
mv "$ITEM" "$BASE_DIR/$TARGET_FOLDER/"

# Bad
mv $ITEM $BASE_DIR/$TARGET_FOLDER/
```

5. **Check return values for critical operations**
```bash
if ! mkdir -p "$NEW_FOLDER_PATH"; then
    echo "Error: Failed to create folder"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Color Code Usage
Use existing color variables for consistency:
- `GREEN` - Success messages
- `RED` - Errors or deletions
- `YELLOW` - Warnings or points
- `CYAN` - Information or stats
- `MAGENTA` - Special modes
- `BLUE` - Skip or neutral actions

## Testing Guidelines

### Automated Testing

CleanRush includes a comprehensive test suite. **All tests must pass before submitting a PR**.

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run_tests.zsh

# Run only unit tests
for test in tests/unit/test_*.zsh; do $test; done

# Run only integration tests
for test in tests/integration/test_*.zsh; do $test; done

# Run a specific test file
./tests/unit/test_os_detection.zsh
```

#### Test Structure
- `tests/run_tests.zsh` - Simple test runner
- `tests/test_utils.zsh` - Testing utilities and assertions
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual functions
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for complete workflows
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and mocks

#### Writing New Tests
When adding new features, include corresponding tests:

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
source "$(dirname "$0")/../test_utils.zsh"

test_group "My Feature Tests"

test_my_new_feature() {
    setup_test_env
    
    # Arrange
    create_test_file "test.txt"
    
    # Act
    # Your feature code here
    
    # Assert
    assert_file_exists "$TEST_DESKTOP/test.txt"
    
    teardown_test_env
}

# Run the test
test_my_new_feature
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

In addition to automated tests, manually verify:

- [ ] First-time setup flow
- [ ] File moving to each folder type
- [ ] File deletion (Trash integration)
  - [ ] macOS: Finder trash via `osascript`
  - [ ] Linux: `gio trash` (if available)
  - [ ] Linux: `trash-put` (if available)
  - [ ] Linux: Fallback to `~/.local/share/Trash/files`
- [ ] Skip functionality
- [ ] Go Mode activation and processing
- [ ] New folder creation
- [ ] Points calculation
- [ ] Achievement unlocking
- [ ] Stats persistence across sessions
- [ ] Config file updates
- [ ] Log file entries
- [ ] OS detection (verify correct OS is detected)

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty Desktop** - Script should exit gracefully
2. **Folders only** - Should skip all folders
3. **Special characters** in filenames
4. **Very long filenames**
5. **Files with spaces** in names
6. **Interrupted sessions** (Ctrl+C handling)

### Platform-Specific Testing

#### macOS Testing
- Verify Finder trash integration works correctly
- Test with `.DS_Store` and `.localized` files
- Confirm items appear in Trash and can be restored

#### Linux Testing
- Test on different distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.)
- Verify trash utilities detection order (`gio` â†’ `trash-put` â†’ fallback)
- Test on different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Confirm XDG trash directory is created if needed
- Verify trash operations work without GUI environment (server/SSH)

## Feature Ideas

Here are some features we'd love to see:

### High Priority
- [ ] Undo last action
- [ ] Dry run mode
- [ ] Configuration backup/restore
- [ ] Custom achievement names

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Multiple source directories
- [ ] File type filtering
- [ ] Scheduled runs
- [ ] Statistics visualization

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Export statistics
- [ ] Theme customization
